Every piece of content a candidate or the system produces should also come with pointers or a guide/checklist of things that piece of content is trying to do. Then we can introduce things like the ask ladder, what to say in a GOTV text, or what to put where on a website or how to word things for different social platforms. This gives education as well as builds trust, since we're showing them best practices, showing them that we can generate stuff on best practices, or guide their own writing with best practices and they'll have great content no matter what. Should build trust that we know everything there is to know about great content and how to write it, making the purchase of things like texts easier.
Does district size matter in outreach plans and channels
Fewer pages before they commit
All pages should show some info but tell users to complete their identity unti it's filled in and approved.
Is there a way to ask people questions and then formulate it into a solid campaign identity?
How can we remind people to look at and refine their campaign identity regularly? Or especially after they do some outreach and receive some feedback (like door knocking, events, texting, or social). And can we just take that feedback and incorporate it somehow in aggregate, like after texting or using eCanvasser? Should this be a specific test they run early on that's low-volume?
What voter data do we get that we can actually segment off of?
How can we show how we'll be tailoring the campaign identity to voter segments
We need to make each piece of content tailored to a few voter segments and show that we're automatically targeting for them
There's an iteration here I need to do with accounting for fundraising, maybe as an extra slider in the campaign plan config
What can we do for opposition and local news scraping?
Israel's idea of having them put in what they can do for budget and time and then that gives us what we need to make up with fundraising and volunteer recruitment.
We need to be able to handle both primaries and generals, how does the strategy differ?
And then everything is totally set up for them, they know what to do and when to do it, and can basically walk away from their computer until something comes up.
And then we just need to have some way of getting them back into the product when they need to. Is a choice of email and text enough? And then sending them what they need right before and asking how it went right after?
We'll really need to make our prompts better, like as good if not better than a PA. And people will need well-formatted, easily-referenceable learning or reference materials so that they can feel comfortable with what they need to do
Once they've completed the stuff for their website, they should be able to then publish it with one click. They're saying the same things a ton of different ways just like a marketer or PM
I think a CRM makes a lot of sense as well, especially if we can start to record if people are going to vote for someone based on records from eCanvasser, Peerly, and maybe event sign-up sheets? That could get really powerful and is the best way to measure field ops effectiveness.
If we can also somehow show how their message is resonating with different demographics, we can help them adjust. This is super long term though, could be worth looking into for later.
If we have everything we need to generate a message, like timing, campaign identity, purpose, etc and absolutely nail the content, it becomes so much easier to make the sell for doing the thing. Like give them an idea of what great would look like so they'll want to do it.
How do we handle omnipresent AI in the product? Is it just baked in wherever needed?
How do people adjust their campaign plans and calendars?
Every outreach or something with a piece of content should say "Review/Approve content" so that candidates first know that it already exists and should be a low lift to do and second so that they have to actually approve the things and check them so we know they're good for us to send them out.
It should be almost easier to send something or post something than not to.
Voter outreach is a lot like the campaign plan then as well. And it doesn't really make sense for it to be separate, it should all be the same thing, right? At least consider it.
Consider how we segment voters as well, that was important from Bryan's vision
Actually just review Bryan's vision once you're feeling good about yours and then see what you should steal. 

X I think adding the human step of reaching out to your phone contacts first makes a lot of sense too, since it's free and quick. It should feel like Rob's coaching them on what to do, how to do it, and what to say so that it actually sticks. 
X I'm thinking about a way to show people all of their scripts, talking points, etc. generated up front
X Maybe there's a way to show them all of that on a page, or wherever makes the most sense.
X Basically, I want it to feel like after doing the foundational stuff, everything's set up and ready to go.
X We need to add voter segmentation to this, in that we generate 3-5 solid oter segments and they choose enough groups from that to hit their vote total with some margin.
X Add numbers to the stuff the identity makes based on what they've configured their campaign plan to be 
X Your core message should include your why statement.
X We need to actually make promises to our users, like we'll generate a custom campaign plan based on your budget and time, and then if you give us 3 pieces of info we'll generate all of the content.
